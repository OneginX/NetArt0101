            <b>The force that through the green fuse drives the flower</b></br>
            The force that through the green fuse drives the flower</br>
            Drives my green age; that blasts the roots of trees</br>
            Is my destroyer.</br>
            And I am dumb to tell the <span style="color:rgb(255, 92, 187) ;">crooked rose</span></br>
            My youth is bent by the same wintry fever.</br></br>

            The force that drives the water through the rocks</br>
            Drives my red blood; that dries the mouthing streams</br>
            Turns mine to wax.</br>
            And I am dumb to mouth unto my veins</br>
            How at the mountain spring the same mouth sucks.</br></br>

            The hand that whirls the water in the pool</br>
            Stirs the quicksand; that ropes the blowing wind</br>
            Hauls my shroud sail.</br>
            And I am dumb to tell the hanging man</br>
            How of my clay is made the hangman's lime.</br></br>

            The lips of time leech to the fountain head;</br>
            Love drips and gathers, but the fallen blood</br>
            Shall calm her sores.</br>
            And I am dumb to tell a weather's wind</br>
            How time has ticked a heaven round the stars.</br></br>

            And I am dumb to tell the lover's tomb</br>
            How at my sheet goes the same crooked worm.</br>
