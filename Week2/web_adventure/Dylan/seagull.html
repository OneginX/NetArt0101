            <b>Poem In October</b>
            It was my thirtieth year to heaven</br>
            Woke to my hearing from harbour and neighbour wood</br>
            And the mussel pooled and the heron</br>
            Priested shore</br>
            The morning beckon</br>
            With water praying and <span style="color:rgb(255, 92, 187) ;">call of seagull and rook</span></br>
            And the knock of sailing boats on the net webbed wall</br>
            Myself to set foot</br>
            That second</br>
            In the still sleeping town and set forth.</br></br>
            
            My birthday began with the water-</br>
            Birds and the birds of the winged trees flying my name</br>
            Above the farms and the white horses</br>
            And I rose</br>
            In rainy autumn</br>
            And walked abroad in a shower of all my days.</br>
            High tide and the heron dived when I took the road</br>
            Over the border</br>
            And the gates</br>
            Of the town closed as the town awoke.</br></br>
            
            A springful of larks in a rolling</br>
            Cloud and the roadside bushes brimming with whistling</br>
            Blackbirds and the sun of October</br>
            Summery</br>
            On the hill's shoulder,</br>
            Here were fond climates and sweet singers suddenly</br>
            Come in the morning where I wandered and listened</br>
            To the rain wringing</br>
            Wind blow cold</br>
            In the wood faraway under me.</br></br>
            
            Pale rain over the dwindling harbour</br>
            And over the sea wet church the size of a snail</br>
            With its horns through mist and the castle</br>
            Brown as owls</br>
            But all the gardens</br>
            Of spring and summer were blooming in the tall tales</br>
            Beyond the border and under the lark full cloud.</br>
            There could I marvel</br>
            My birthday</br>
            Away but the weather turned around.</br></br>
            
            It turned away from the blithe country</br>
            And down the other air and the blue altered sky</br>
            Streamed again a wonder of summer</br>
            With apples</br>
            Pears and red currants</br>
            And I saw in the turning so clearly a child's</br>
            Forgotten mornings when he walked with his mother</br>
            Through the parables</br>
            Of sun light</br>
            And the legends of the green chapels</br></br>
            
            And the twice told fields of infancy</br>
            That his tears burned my cheeks and his heart moved in mine.</br>
            These were the woods the river and sea</br>
            Where a boy</br>
            In the listening</br>
            Summertime of the dead whispered the truth of his joy</br>
            To the trees and the stones and the fish in the tide.</br>
            And the mystery</br>
            Sang alive</br>
            Still in the water and singingbirds.</br></br>
            
            And there could I marvel my birthday</br>
            Away but the weather turned around. And the true</br>
            Joy of the long dead child sang burning</br>
            In the sun.</br>
            It was my thirtieth</br>
            Year to heaven stood there then in the summer noon</br>
            Though the town below lay leaved with October blood.</br>
            O may my heart's truth</br>
            Still be sung</br>
            On this high hill in a year's turning.</br>
