            <b>On A Wedding Anniversary</b></br>
            The sky is torn across</br>
            This ragged anniversary of two</br>
            Who moved for three years in tune</br>
            Down the long walks of their vows.</br></br>
            
            Now their love lies a loss</br>
            And Love and his patients roar on a chain;</br>
            From every tune or <span style="color:rgb(255, 92, 187) ;">crater</br>
            Carrying cloud</span>, Death strikes their house.</br></br>
            
            Too late in the wrong rain</br>
            They come together whom their love parted:</br>
            The windows pour into their heart</br>
            And the doors burn in their brain.</br>
