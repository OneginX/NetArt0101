            <b>When once the twilight locks no longer</b></br>
            When once the twilight locks no longer</br>
            Locked in the long worm of my finger</br>
            Nor damned the sea that sped about my fist,</br>
            The mouth of time sucked, like a sponge,</br>
            The milky acid on each hinge,</br>
            And swallowed dry the waters of the breast.</br></br>
            
            When the galactic sea was sucked</br>
            And all the dry seabed unlocked,</br>
            I sent my creature scouting on the globe,</br>
            That globe itself of hair and bone</br>
            That, sewn to me by nerve and brain,</br>
            Had stringed my flask of matter to his rib.</br></br>
            
            My fuses are timed to charge his heart,</br>
            He blew like powder to the light</br>
            And held a little sabbath with the sun,</br>
            But when the stars, assuming shape,</br>
            Drew in his eyes the straws of sleep</br>
            He drowned his father's magics in a dream.</br></br>
            
            All issue armoured, of the grave,</br>
            The redhaired cancer still alive,</br>
            The cataracted eyes that filmed their cloth;</br>
            Some dead undid their bushy jaws,</br>
            And bags of blood let out their flies;</br>
            He had by heart the Christ-cross-row of death.</br></br>
            
            Sleep navigates the tides of time;</br>
            The dry Sargasso of the tomb</br>
            Gives up its dead to such a working sea;</br>
            And sleep rolls mute above the beds</br>
            Where fishes' food is fed the shades</br>
            Who periscope through flowers to the sky.</br></br>
            
            When once the twilight screws were turned,</br>
            And mother milk was stiff as sand,</br>
            I sent my own ambassador to light;</br>
            By trick or chance he fell asleep</br>
            And conjured up a carcass shape</br>
            To rob me of my fluids in his heart.</br></br>
            
            Awake, my sleeper, to the sun,</br>
            A worker in the morning town,</br>
            And leave the poppied pickthank where he lies;</br>
            The fences of the light are down,</br>
            All but the briskest riders thrown</br>
            And <span style="color:rgb(255, 92, 187) ;">worlds hang on the trees</span>.</br>
