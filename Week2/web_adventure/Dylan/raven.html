            Especially when the October wind</br>
            With frosty fingers punishes my hair,</br>
            Caught by the crabbing sun I walk on fire</br>
            And cast a shadow crab upon the land,</br>
            By the sea's side, hearing the noise of birds,</br>
            Hearing the <span style="color:rgb(255, 92, 187) ;">raven cough in winter sticks</span>,</br>
            My busy heart who shudders as she talks</br>
            Sheds the syllabic blood and drains her words.</br></br>
            
            Shut, too, in a tower of words, I mark</br>
            On the horizon walking like the trees</br>
            The wordy shapes of women, and the rows</br>
            Of the star-gestured children in the park.</br>
            Some let me make you of the vowelled beeches,</br>
            Some of the oaken voices, from the roots</br>
            Of many a thorny shire tell you notes,</br>
            Some let me make you of the water's speeches.</br></br>
            
            Behind a pot of ferns the wagging clock</br>
            Tells me the hour's word, the neural meaning</br>
            Flies on the shafted disk, declaims the morning</br>
            And tells the windy weather in the cock.</br>
            Some let me make you of the meadow's signs;</br>
            The signal grass that tells me all I know</br>
            Breaks with the wormy winter through the eye.</br>
            Some let me tell you of the raven's sins.</br></br>
            
            Especially when the October wind</br>
            (Some let me make you of autumnal spells,</br>
            The spider-tongued, and the loud hill of Wales)</br>
            With fists of turnips punishes the land,</br>
            Some let me make you of the heartless words.</br>
            The heart is drained that, spelling in the scurry</br>
            Of chemic blood, warned of the coming fury.</br>
            By the sea's side hear the dark-vowelled birds.</br>
