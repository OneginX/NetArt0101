            <b>III</b></br>
            Ah vastness of pines, murmur of waves breaking,</br>
            slow play of lights, <span style="color:rgb(251, 251, 130) ;">solitary bell</span>,</br>
            twilight falling in your eyes, toy doll,</br>
            earth-shell, in whom the earth sings!</br>
            </br>
            In you the rivers sing and my soul flees in them</br>
            as you desire, and you sent it where you will.</br>
            Aim my road on your bow of hope</br>
            and in a frenzy I will free my flock of arrows.</br>
            </br>
            On all sides I see your waist of fog,</br>
            and your silence hunts down my afflicted hours;</br>
            my kisses anchor, and my moist desire nests</br>
            in you with your arms of transparent stone.</br>
            </br>
            Ah your mysterious voice that love tolls and darkens</br>
            in the resonant and dying evening!</br>
            Thus in deep hours I have seen, over the fields,</br>
            the ears of wheat tolling in the mouth of the wind.</br>
