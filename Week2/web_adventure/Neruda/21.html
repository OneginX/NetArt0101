            <b>The Song of Despair</b></br>
            The memory of you emerges from the night around me.</br>
            The river mingles its stubborn lament with the sea.</br></br>

            Deserted like the wharves at dawn.</br>
            It is the hour of departure, oh deserted one!</br></br>

            Cold flower heads are raining over my heart.</br>
            Oh pit of debris, fierce cave of the shipwrecked.</br></br>

            In you the wars and the flights accumulated.</br>
            From you the wings of the song birds rose.</br></br>

            You swallowed everything, like distance.</br>
            Like the sea, like time. In you everything sank!</br></br>

            It was the happy hour of the assault and the kiss.</br>
            The hour of the spell that blazed like a lighthouse.</br></br>

            Pilot's dread, fury of blind driver,</br>
            turbulent drunkenness of love, in you everything sank!</br></br>

            In the childhood of mist my soul, winged and wounded.</br>
            Lost discoverer, in you everything sank!</br></br>

            You girdled sorrow, you clung to desire,</br>
            sadness stunned you, in you everything sank!</br></br>

            I made the wall of shadow draw back,</br>
            beyond desire and act, I walked on.</br></br>

            Oh flesh, my own flesh, woman whom I loved and lost,</br>
            I summon you in the moist hour, I raise my song to you.</br></br>

            Like a jar you housed the infinite tenderness,</br>
            and the infinite oblivion shattered you like a jar.</br></br>

            There was the black solitude of the islands,</br>
            and there, woman of love, your arms took me in.</br></br>

            There was thirst and hunger, and you were the fruit.</br>
            There were grief and ruins, and you were the miracle.</br></br>

            Ah woman, I do not know how you could contain me</br>
            in the earth of your soul, in the cross of your arms!</br></br>

            How terrible and brief was my desire of you!</br>
            How difficult and drunken, how tensed and avid.</br></br>

            Cemetery of kisses, there is still fire in your tombs,</br>
            still the fruited boughs burn, pecked at by birds.</br></br>

            Oh the bitten mouth, oh the kissed limbs,</br>
            oh the hungering teeth, oh the entwined bodies.</br></br>

            Oh the mad coupling of hope and force</br>
            in which we merged and despaired.</br></br>

            And the tenderness, light as water and as flour.</br>
            And the word scarcely begun on the lips.</br></br>

            This was my destiny and in it was my voyage of my longing,</br>
            and in it my longing fell, in you everything sank!</br></br>

            Oh pit of debris, everything fell into you,</br>
            what sorrow did you not express, in what sorrow are you
            not drowned!</br></br>

            <span style="color:rgb(251, 251, 130) ;">From billow to billow</span> you still called and sang.</br>
            Standing like a sailor in the prow of a vessel.</br></br>

            You still flowered in songs, you still broke the currents.</br>
            Oh pit of debris, open and bitter well.</br></br>

            Pale blind diver, luckless slinger,</br>
            lost discoverer, in you everything sank!</br></br>

            It is the hour of departure, the hard cold hour</br>
            which the night fastens to all the timetables.</br></br>

            The rustling belt of the sea girdles the shore.</br>
            Cold stars heave up, black birds migrate.</br></br>

            Deserted like the wharves at dawn.</br>
            Only the tremulous shadow twists in my hands.</br></br>

            Oh farther than everything. Oh farther than everything.</br>
            It is the hour of departure. Oh abandoned one!</br>
