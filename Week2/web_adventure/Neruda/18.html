            <b>XVIII</b></br>
            Here I love you.</br>
            In the dark pines the wind disentangles itself.</br>
            The moon glows like phosphorous on the vagrant waters.</br>
            Days, all one kind, go chasing each other.</br></br>

            The snow unfurls in dancing figures.</br>
            A silver gull slips down from the west.</br>
            Sometimes a sail. High, high stars.</br></br>

            Oh the black cross of a ship.</br>
            Alone.</br>
            Sometimes I get up early and even my soul is wet.</br>
            Far away the sea sounds and resounds.</br>
            This is a port.</br>
            Here I love you.</br></br>

            Here I love you and the horizon hides you in vain.</br>
            I love you still among these cold things.</br>
            Sometimes my kisses go on those heavy vessels</br>
            that cross the sea towards no arrival.</br>
            I see myself forgotten like those <span style="color:rgb(251, 251, 130) ;">old anchors</span>.</br>
            The piers sadden when the afternoon moors there.</br>
            My life grows tired, hungry to no purpose.</br>
            I love what I do not have. You are so far.</br>
            My loathing wrestles with the slow twilights.</br>
            But night comes and starts to sing to me.</br>
            The moon turns its clockwork dream.</br>
            The biggest stars look at me with your eyes.</br>
            And as I love you, the pines in the wind</br>
            want to sing your name with their leaves of wire.</br>
