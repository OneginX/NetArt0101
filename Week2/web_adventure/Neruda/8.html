            <span style="color:rgb(251, 251, 130) ;">White bee</span>, you buzz in my soul, drunk with honey,</br>
            and your flight winds in slow spirals of smoke.</br></br>

            I am the one without hope, the word without echoes,</br>
            he who lost everything and he who had everything.</br></br>

            Last hawser, in you creaks my last longing.</br>
            In my barren land you are the final rose.</br></br>

            Ah you who are silent!</br></br>

            Let your deep eyes close. There the night flutters.</br>
            Ah your body, a frightened statue, naked.</br></br>

            You have deep eyes in which the night flails.</br>
            Cool arms of flowers and a lap of rose.</br></br>

            Your breasts seem like white snails.</br>
            A butterfly of shadow has come to sleep on your belly.</br></br>

            Ah you who are silent!</br></br>

            Here is the solitude from which you are silent.</br>
            It is raining. The sea wind is hunting stray gulls.</br></br>

            The water walks barefoot in the wet streets.</br>
            From the tree the leaves complain as though they were sick.</br></br>

            White bee, even when you are gone you buzz in my soul.</br>
            You live again in time, slender and silent.</br></br>

            Ah you who are silent!</br>
