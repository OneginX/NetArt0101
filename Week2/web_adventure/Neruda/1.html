            <b>I</b></br>
            Body of a woman, <span style="color:rgb(251, 251, 130) ;">white hills, white thighs,</span></br>
            you look like a world, lying in surrender.</br>
            My rough peasant's body digs in you</br>
            and makes the sun leap from the depth of the earth.</br></br>

            I was alone like a tunnel. The birds fled from me,</br>
            and night swamped me with its crushing invasion.</br>
            To survive myself I forged you like a weapon,</br>
            like an arrow in my bow, a stone in my sling.</br></br>

            But the hour of vengeance falls, and I love you.</br>
            Body of skin, of moss, of eager and firm milk.</br>
            Oh the goblets of the breast! Oh the eyes of absence</br>
            Oh the roses of the pubis! Oh your voice, slow and sad!</br></br>

            Body of a woman, I will persist in your grace.</br>
            My thirst, my boundless desire, my shifting road!</br>
            Dark river-beds where the eternal thirst flows</br>
            and weariness follows, and the infinite ache.</br>
